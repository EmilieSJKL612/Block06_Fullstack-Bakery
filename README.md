# Block06_Fullstack-Bakery

Better approach (after block 03- today's 06): do NOT memorize the syntax of html or css, but rather, know how to look up info or answers I need via the MDN documentations/ w3Schools intro and practice or twitter bootstrap... 
=> this is more time-efficient and I learned more from this process than trying to remember every syntax!
